data <- read.table("TSICHR22RAW.raw")
```


# STR
```{r}
library(HardyWeinberg)
data("NistSTRs")
```

## How many individuals and how many STRs contains the database?
```{r}
print(paste0("Therer are ",dim(NistSTRs)[1]," individuals"))
print(paste0("Therer are ",dim(NistSTRs)[2]," STRs"))
```

## Write a function that determines the number of alleles for a STR. Determine the number of alleles for each STR in the database. Compute basic descriptive statistics of the number of alleles (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum).

```{r}
numberAlleles <- function(STR){
  return(length(unique(STR)))
}

alleles <- numeric(ncol(NistSTRs))
for(i in 1:ncol(NistSTRs)){
  alleles[i] <- numberAlleles(NistSTRs[,i])
}

print("This is the number of alleles in each STR:")
print(alleles)
```

```{r}
print(paste0("The mean of alleles is ",mean(alleles)))
print(paste0("The standard deviation of the number of alleles is ",sd(alleles)))
print(paste0("The median of alleles is ",median(alleles)))
print(paste0("The minimum of alleles is ",min(alleles)))
print(paste0("The maximum of alleles is ",max(alleles)))
```
## Make a table with the number of STRs for a given number of alleles and present a barplot of the number STRs in each category. What is the most common number of alleles for an STR?

```{r}
tbl <- table(alleles)
barplot(tbl)
```
As we can see in the barplot, the most common number of alleles for an STR is 7

## Compute the expected heterozygosity for each STR. Make a histogram of the expected heterozygosity over all STRS. Compute the average expected heterozygosity over all STRs.

```{r}
expectedH <- numeric(ncol(NistSTRs))

for(i in 1:ncol(NistSTRs)){
  dis <- unique(NistSTRs[,i])
  expectedH[i] <- 1/length(dis)
}
hist(expectedH)
```
```{r}
print(paste0("The average expected heterozygosity is ", mean(expectedH)))
```

## Calculate also the observed heterozygosity for each STR. Plot observed against expected heterozy- gosity, using all STRs. What do you observe?

```{r}

```
